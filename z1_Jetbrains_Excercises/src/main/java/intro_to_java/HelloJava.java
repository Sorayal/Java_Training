Hello, Java
Write a simple program that includes the main method.

Your class must be named Main if it is public; otherwise, it may have any name. It's a restriction of the platform, not Java.

The program should print the following text:

Hello, Java!

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
