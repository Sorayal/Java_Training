Test learners
We need your help to improve an adaptive system. There's a program that asks learners what programming language they are learning. There are four options, one of them is correct:

Java
Kotlin
Scala
Python
Your task: read the answerâ€™s number from the standard input and output the result of the test: "Yes!", "No!" or "Unknown number". We hope you know which answer is correct. You don't need to print the question itself.


Sample Input:
1

Sample Output:
Yes!


Sample Input:
6

Sample Output:
Unknown number
