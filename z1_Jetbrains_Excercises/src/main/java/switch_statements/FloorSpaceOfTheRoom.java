/*
Floor-space of the room
Citizens of the country named Malevia often experiment with the shapes of their rooms. The rooms can be triangular, rectangular, and round.

Write a program that calculates the floor area of the rooms.

Input data format: The type of the room shape and the relevant parameters.

Output data format: The area of the resulting room.

Note that the value of 3.14 is used instead of the number Ï€ in Malevia.

Hint

Input format used by the Malevians:

triangle
a
b
c
where a, b, and c are lengths of the triangle sides.

rectangle
a
b
where a and b are lengths of the rectangle sides.

circle
r
where r is the radius of the circle.

Note that the input values (a, b, c, r) are doubles, and your answer should be too.


Sample Input:
rectangle
4
10

Sample Output:
40.0


Sample Input:
circle
5

Sample Output:
78.5


Sample Input:
triangle
3
3
3

Sample Output:
3.897114317029974
